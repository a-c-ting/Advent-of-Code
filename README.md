# Advent-of-Code
This repo contains solutions to AoC programming problems/puzzles using Go (golang). My goal is to mainly familiarize with Go.
For simplicity and organization purposes, most of the codes per problem are in a single file. Only exception is the intcode processor.

## Steps to run:
1. Save the AoC puzzle input as DayXXPartY.txt files and place them in the same folder as the .go files.
    1. So far all puzzles I've done only use one input, so they remain as DayXXPart1.txt even in Part 2.
2. Go to the year folder. e.g. 2019 for 2019 problems
3. execute 'go run DayXXPartY.go'
