# Advent-of-Code
This repo contains solutions to AoC programming problems/puzzles using Go (golang).
For simplicity and organization purposes, all codes per problem are in a single file.
They can all be run using 'go run xxxx.go'.

If you need to test the codes, save the AoC puzzle input as DayXXPartY.txt files and put them in the same folder as the .go files.

Check out Advent of Code if you also wanna do these problems!
